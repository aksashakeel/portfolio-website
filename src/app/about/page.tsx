            <p>My name is Aqsa Shakeel, and I am learning web development and programming languages for the first time. I am a beginner in web development.</p>

            <p>My IT journey began in 2022 when I completed a short course in Computer Information Technology (CIT). I earned an A+1 certificate for the course, which marked the start of my passion for tech and web development.</p>

            <p>This experience sparked my interest in technology and web development, and I am now focused on expanding my skills in programming languages and building dynamic, user-friendly websites.</p>
